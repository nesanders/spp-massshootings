# Code Associated With "The Role of Prior Information in Inference on the Annualized Rates of Mass Shootings in the United States"

## By Nathan Sanders and Victor Lei

The python script in this repository generates all analysis, visualizations, and statistics quoted in the forthcoming paper "The Role of Prior Information in Inference on the Annualized Rates of Mass Shootings in the United States" to appear in the journal Statistics & Public Policy.  The file "gp_model_final.stan" defines the Gaussian process statistical model used in the paper.  A static copy of the source dataset, transformed data to be fed to the model, and intermediate stochastic sampling outputs are also shared in this repository.

This project makes use of the [database of public mass shootings compiled by Mother Jones magazine](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data).

An [earlier version of this analysis](https://github.com/nesanders/massshootings/) was prepared in Jupyter notebook format for presentation at the first annual [StanCon](http://mc-stan.org/events/stancon.html) meeting in January 2017.

This repository will be updated with a link to the published paper when available.
